#### Contributors: Anthony DiFalco

#### A site where Pierre can keep track of outgoing orders for vendors

## Technologies Used

* .NET
* ASP.NET Core

## Description

This project uses ASP.NET Core to simulate a program that allows Pierre to keep track of and update outgoing orders from his bakery. 

From home, Pierre can view a list of his vendors or add new vendors. Adding a new vendor requires a name but includes an optional description. 

Viewing a vendor allows Pierre to further view that vendor's orders. Orders can be added from the vendor page and have optional input fields for basic order information and any number of six purchase options.

viewing an order displays each item, its quantity, cast, and the toal cost of all items. orders can be set to "complete" from their page.
